 1866  git init
 1867* git remote add origin https://github.com/urvi3012/Git_Learn.gi
 1868  git status
 1869  git add .
 1870  git commit -m "initial commit"
 1871  git push origin main
 1872  git push origin master




For new task, we add a branch

 1877  git checkout -b "Steps"  # make  branch and get into it
 1878  git checkout master   	# switch to the branch (here going into master)
 1880  git checkout Steps
 1881  git branch # gives list of branches with active in green 

Adding new files to branch

 1885  git status
 1886  git add notes.txt
 1887  git status
 1888  git commit -m "Learn through it"
 1889  git push origin Steps

Now we can go to PR, creat request, assign assignie and reviewer.

After review, we get sign for re check at right

after its approoved, we can merge and add it to main branch then, the branch is deleted (all thouthg UI here)

pull is used to sync local and remote
